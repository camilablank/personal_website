Marzipan is usually used as a filling or decoration in baked goods, like cakes and pastries. If you're looking for a midnight snack, I'd be happy to suggest some alternatives that might satisfy your cravings. Some popular options include fruits, nuts, cheese, crackers, or even a warm beverage like tea or hot chocolate."</p>
