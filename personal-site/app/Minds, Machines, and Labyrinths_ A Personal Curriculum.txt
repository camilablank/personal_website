Minds, Machines, and Labyrinths: A Personal Curriculum


Where is the line between human and nonhuman? 


I believe this is one of the most important philosophical questions we can ask, especially given the incredible speed of recent innovation in artificial intelligence. To me, the most fascinating works of literature, art, and music grapple with the following binaries: human vs. nonhuman, reality vs. simulation, consciousness vs. unconsciousness.


As I go into my second year at Stanford, most of my academic classes will focus on math, AI, and neuroscience. To round this out, I am curating a curriculum for myself. The theme “Minds, Machines, and Labyrinths” takes inspiration from Borges, in whose work the labyrinth symbolizes the complex nature of the mind and the universe.


Below I will list some of the works I will explore. Many are new to me, but I’ve included some old favorites as well (the music section is mainly just an excuse to talk about things I love).
